# Behind the Beats: Curation of a Dataset for Exploring German Rap Language

![](doc/data_lit_23-24_paper/scraping_pipeline.png)

## Abstract

Rap music is one of the most influential contemporary music genres with a huge societal significance.
Existing analyses of rap often rely on self-performed web scraping approaches and do not take popularity of songs into
account. In this work, we contribute a novel dataset for German rap lyrics analysis, comprising 13,997 songs that
achieved high chart positions during the years 2015-2023. Each song is further annotated with moderation labels,
reflecting the presence of harassment, violence, sexuality, hate and self-harm, enabling analysis of harmful or explicit
content within German rap. The proposed dataset opens up the possibility to explore individual artistsâ€™ lyrical styles
as well as the temporal development of German rap. The data and code are made publicly available for further research1.

## Setup

Create python venv with python 3.10 and install requirements:

```bash
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy the file .env.base to .env and fill in the secrets.

## Running the scraping pipeline

The main script for scraping the data can be found in `src/main.py`.

Run the script with:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Accessing the data

The scraped data is stored in the `data` folder:

- `data/csv/charts.csv`: Dataset with the scraped charts data.
- `data/csv/songs.csv`: Dataset with the scraped songs data (no lyrics).
- `data/csv/moderation.csv`: Dataset with the content moderation predictions.
- `data/lyrics.zip`: Zip file with the scraped lyrics.

## Experiments

The experiments are stored in the `experiments` folder:

- `experiments/exp_PD_001_AlgorithmicAnalysis.ipynb`: Notebook with the algorithmic analysis of the moderation labels.
- `experiments/exp_PD_002_DeToxAnalysis.ipynb`: Notebook with the analysis of the DeTox hate speech labels.

Results of the experiments are stored in the `data/experiments` folder.
